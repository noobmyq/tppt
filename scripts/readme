## readme
* need to run, notice the newgrp kvm to make the group change effective

 **it seems that changing the group to kvm will cause unexpected behavior to OSv setup, so always check group identifier with `id` before setting up OSv**
 
 **or, use `sg kvm -c` for qemu**
```shell
sudo usermod -aG kvm $USER
newgrp kvm
source source.sh
```

## shmem setup
* need to use manually built qemu to run so that it has newest AVX
```shell
rum # define in source.sh
### inside vm
cd apps/shmem_matmu
make mem
```
